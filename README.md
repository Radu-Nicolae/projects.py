## projects.py

This repo contains a few personal projects which were built to exercise and consolidate my Python skills and algorithmically thinking. The projects are sorted by difficulty - the first project is the easiest and the last the most difficult.

The project ideas were inspired from freeCodeCamp, as well as some solutions to a few encountered difficulties.
